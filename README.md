# Custom-Vocabulary-Recognition
Enhance your speech recognition program to act as a voice-controlled assistant
Integrate your speech recognition system with a task management or note-taking application. Users can add reminders or create notes by speaking, 
and your program converts the speech to text.

Print What You Say:
Captures spoken input using the microphone and displays the recognized text on the GUI.

Google Search:
Initiates a Google search based on the user's spoken input, opening the default web browser with the search results.

YouTube Search:
Performs a YouTube search based on the user's spoken input, launching the default web browser with the search results.

Text-to-Speech:
Converts the text entered in a Text widget to speech using the pyttsx3 library.

The GUI is designed with a title, informative labels, and appropriately styled buttons. Users can interact with the application through voice commands and observe the outcomes on the GUI. This project demonstrates a practical implementation of speech recognition and synthesis within a user-friendly interface.
